If you spend US$70 a week on food deliveries, you are contributing in increasing carbon footprint to about 450%.Online deliveries have increased significantly in today's world, especially from Covid times. Five out of ten 2 wheelers seen on the road are for food deliveries. Home-delivered food has a huge climate cost. We DJS Miles identified this issue and felt our social responsibility to conserve our mother earth. On the occasion of world environment day we conducted an \"Eco-Friendly Delivery Drive.\"\nLocating prime locations in the city and major food corners, we reached out to nearly 100+ delivery persons waiting to collect their food parcels and made them aware about this serious rising issue. We interacted with them making them understand how they could drive efficiently thus reducing carbon footprint, introduced them to Ev's and collected their opinions. \nWe concluded the interaction with they taking an oath to protect our Mother Earth henceforth. We appealed them to stick a sticker about the same on their vehicle which will remind them their oath. \n\nSo, here we did our job! What are you'll waiting for? We as a team would request and appeal you'll to help us in our campaign and do your own bit in making Earth a better place to live in!\n\n@zomato @swiggyindia @dunzo_it @zeptonow \n\n@shell_ecomarathon\n#shell #shellecomarathon #shellecomarathonasia #sustainablefuture #shellecomarathonindia #prototype #zomato #swiggy #worldenvironmentday #saveearth #ev",

Latest estimates shows that the world now discards approximately 50 million tonnes of e-waste per year. In 2021 alone, the global share of e-waste documented to be collected and properly recycled was just 17.4 percent. \n\nTaking into consideration these eye-opening facts, We team DJS Miles in collaboration with @karosambhav successfully carried out an E-Waste Campaign in our college, Dwarkadas J. Sanghvi College of Engineering from 25th to 28th May, 2022.\n\nA webinar was conducted with Karo Sambhav on 25th May, 2022 to enlighten all the students about  E-waste management, circular economy along with the importance and methods of disposing E-Waste correctly, and how one could contribute towards a cleaner environment.\n\nFrom 26th-28th May, we installed boxes and appealed to each and every student to come forward and donate their E-waste in the boxes. Achieving our goal, we successfully collected more than 100 kg of E-Waste from the students and the faculty and successfully sent them for recycling to Karo Sambhav. \n\nDJS Miles facilitated awareness among students, teachers and staff members on various aspects of e-waste management, circular economy, and leading a sustainable way of life.\n\n@shell_ecomarathon #shell #shellecomarathon #shellecomarathonasia #shellecomarathonindia #djsce #sae #energy #EV #electric #prototype #efficiency #sustainablefuture #makeinindia #mumbai #ewaste #ewastemanagement #electronicwaste #recycle",
