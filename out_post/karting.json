We attempted to contact them several times, and every time we received a different contact for delivering our kart. We tried calling them, but all they said was that we'd get our kart the next day. We believed them until the evening of August 21st, when our transport person informed us that he would not be delivering our kart due to their internal disputes. After coaxing him all night, we finally got a phone number from the various Packers and Movers on the first day of our competition.\nWe spoke with him, and he demanded Rs. 26000 in order to deliver our kart in two hours. We didn't have much of a choice.\nWe hoped that we would receive our package on time and still be able to compete. Six of our boxes arrived that evening, giving everyone on the crew a reason to be optimistic. But didn't receive our chassis, axle, or bodyworks. Furthermore, we discovered that the transport worker had already misplaced our kart's side bodyworks and nose and\nas a result, we had to manufacture them on the second to last day of our competition. Our hopes had been crushed previously, but on August 25(last day of the competition) at 2.30 a.m., we received our chassis and axle. The Go Kart was assembled by all the members while they were up all night.\nFinally with our go kart in hand, we entered the competition with the rising sun on the last day.\nWe still couldn't participate in the dynamic events as the judges didn\u2019t have enough time to conduct our TI. Our whole team was in tears watching other karts perform while we stood there feeling helpless.\n*Continued in comments*."
